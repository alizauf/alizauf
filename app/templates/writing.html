<p class="pageintro"> As a former travel writer, curriculum writer, and high school English teacher, my writing has appeared in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008SMS2PC/ref=nav_timeline_asin?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Let's Go France 2008</a>, <a href="https://www.flocabulary.com/lesson/teach-the-fertile-crescent-with-a-croissant/">all across Flocabulary's curricula</a>, and crumpled up in the back of my students' binders. I currently write articles about education and technology.</p>
